# Interactive-Tic-Tac-Toe-in-Python



Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Python
This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. The game allows two players to compete on a 3x3 grid, where they take turns marking "X" or "O" in an attempt to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

Key Features:
Two-Player Mode: Allows two players to play against each other.
Game Logic: Implements rules for checking a win, draw, and valid moves.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple text-based interface to display the board and interact with players.
Turn-based Gameplay: Players alternate turns, and the game automatically detects the winner or a draw.
Tools Used:
Python for game logic and implementation.
Basic terminal or console for interaction and display.
Objective:
The goal of this project is to demonstrate Python programming skills through game development, focusing on concepts like conditionals, loops, functions, and user input handling.

Feel free to explore the code and improve upon the game by adding new features like AI or graphical user interface (GUI).
